# Firestore Data Model for Managing Users and Posts

This project demonstrates a data model implemented in Firestore for managing users and their associated posts. It provides flexibility in handling user-related data efficiently while ensuring integrity and performance.

## 1. Embedding `posts` Collection within `users` Collection

Embedding the `posts` collection within the `users` collection offers several advantages:

- **Simplified Queries**: It simplifies queries when accessing a user's posts since posts are directly nested within the user document. This reduces the number of reads needed and improves query efficiency.

- **Optimized Access**: Users can easily access their posts with a single read operation, which is beneficial for applications where posts are always accessed in the context of a user.

## 2. Keeping `posts` Collection Separate

Alternatively, keeping the `posts` collection separate allows for more flexibility and scalability:

- **Independent Access**: Posts can be accessed independently of users, which is useful if posts need to be queried globally or if they have relationships with entities besides users.

- **Structured Management**: It facilitates managing posts in a more structured manner, especially when posts have complex relationships with other entities.

- **Avoiding Scalability Issues**: Keeping the `posts` collection separate can prevent potential scalability issues, especially if a user has a large number of posts, as Firestore documents have size limits.
