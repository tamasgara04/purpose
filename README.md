# purpose
This project is a demonstration of building a secure API using Flask, implementing advanced authentication mechanisms such as OAuth2 and JWT. The API provides endpoints for user registration, login, data retrieval, and manipulation while ensuring robust security features and efficient handling of user credentials and access tokens.

# Tasks:

## Objectives:

## 1. Advanced Authentication and API Development:
Develop a secure API using Flask that supports OAuth2 and JWT for authentication. Your API should demonstrate advanced security features and efficient handling of user credentials and access tokens.

## 2. Complex Data Relationship Handling:
Design and implement a data model capable of managing complex relationships. Utilize Firestore to showcase your ability to manipulate and query data efficiently, ensuring integrity and performance.

## 3. Real-time Data Processing:
 Implement a feature using WebSockets that allows for real-time data processing and communication. This feature should highlight your ability to handle concurrent data streams and provide a seamless user experience.

## 4. Machine Learning Model Integration:
Integrate a pre-trained machine learning model into your application using PyTorch. Demonstrate your application's ability to interact with the model, process inputs, and display outputs in a meaningful way.

## 5. API Rate Limiting and Caching:
 Implement rate limiting and caching mechanisms to optimize the performance of your API. Your solution should demonstrate an understanding of how to manage and scale API requests efficiently.


## Submission Guidelines:
Your submission should be organized within a GitHub repository containing:
Complete source code with detailed comments and documentation.
A comprehensive README file that includes setup instructions, how to run the application, and a guide to navigating your codebase.
A written overview discussing your design choices, the challenges you faced, and how you overcame them.
