## Code Documentation

### Overview
This code defines a custom machine learning class (`CustML`) for question answering using the Hugging Face Transformers library. It loads a pre-trained BERT model and tokenizer for question answering and provides a method to answer questions based on a given context.

### Dependencies
- **transformers**: Hugging Face Transformers library for natural language processing tasks.
- **torch**: PyTorch library for deep learning.

### Class `CustML`
- **tokenizer**: Instance of AutoTokenizer for tokenizing text inputs.
- **model**: Instance of AutoModelForQuestionAnswering for question answering.
- **context**: Default context for answering questions.

### Constructor `__init__`
- Initializes the tokenizer and model with a pre-trained BERT model for question answering.
- Sets the default context for answering questions.

### Method `get_extra_content`
- Takes additional context as input and formats it for inclusion in the question answering process.
- Formats the extra context by iterating over lines and extracting name and email information.

### Method `answer_question`
- Takes a question and extra context as input and predicts an answer based on the provided context and question.
- Tokenizes the question and context, and performs inference using the pre-trained BERT model.
- Decodes the predicted answer span from the model's outputs and returns the answer.

### Execution
- The `__init__` method loads the tokenizer and model with a pre-trained BERT model.
- The `answer_question` method is used to answer questions based on the provided context.

### Note
- Ensure correct setup and compatibility with Hugging Face Transformers library.
- The default context provided in the `__init__` method can be replaced or extended as needed for specific use cases.
